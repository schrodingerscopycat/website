				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Hello world, welcome to Schrödinger's Copycat. A new site destined to teach you the beauty of this world.</p>
				<p>This webpage is dedicated to those crazy ones that want to understand maths, technology, artificial-intelligence through the beauty of its core.</p>
				<p>The name of this site "Schrödinger's Copycat is in honor of a black and white kitten named "Mabel". She was as close as a sister or a daughter to me, always by my side. In my incompetence of taking care of her, one day she disappeared. Thinking of the worst and still hoping she's alive.</p>
				<p><em>Schrödinger's Copycat</em> Nothing in this world is completly original, eveyone is a copy of someone else to a greater or lesser extent because of our environment, influences, learnings, customs, ideologies and so on. We always are a part of someone else with a combination of our personality, giving as result a new identity, "one-self". Be proud of yourself!</p>
